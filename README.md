# Spam SMS Detection

A simple web app built with Flask that classifies SMS messages as **Spam** or **Ham** using a Logistic Regression model. The model uses **NLTK** for preprocessing and **TF-IDF** features via **scikit-learn**.

## Features
- Clean web interface to input SMS text
- Preprocessing: tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming
- TF-IDF-based feature extraction
- Logistic Regression for prediction
- Instant spam/ham classification result
